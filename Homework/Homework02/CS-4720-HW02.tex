\section*{Answers to homework problems:}

\begin{enumerate}
% Question 2
\item Consider the graph in Figure 3.21, in which each edge - except the edge connecting $b$ and $c$ - is labeled as a strong tie (S) or a weak tie (W).\\
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figure_3_21}
\end{center}
According to the theory of strong and weak ties, with the strong triadic closure assumption, how would you expect the edge connecting b and c to be labeled? Give a brief (1-3 sentence) explanation for your answer.
% Question 3
\item  In the social network depicted in Figure 3.22, with each edge labeled as either a strong or weak tie, which nodes satisfy the Strong Triadic Closure Property from Chapter 3, and which do not? Provide an explanation for your answer

% Question 4
\item In the social network depicted in Figure 3.23 with each edge labeled as either a strong or weak tie, which two nodes violate the Strong Triadic Closure Property? Provide an explanation for your answer

\item  In the social network depicted in Figure 3.24, with each edge labeled as either a strong or weak tie, which nodes satisfy the Strong Triadic Closure Property from Chapter 3, and which do not? Provide an explanation for your answer.
