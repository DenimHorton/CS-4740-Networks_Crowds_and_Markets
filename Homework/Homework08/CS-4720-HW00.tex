Homework \#  \textcolor{red}{CHANGE ME!}

Student: (Robert Denim Horton)
\end{Large}
\end{center}

Suppose there are 2 ad slots each with its own clickthrough rate: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|} 
 \hline
 Slot & Click Through Rate \\ 
 \hline\hline
 a & 10 \\ 
 \hline
 b & 7 \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
And suppose there are 3 advertisers:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
 \hline
 Advertiser & Valuation Per Click \\ 
 \hline\hline
 x & 10 \\
 \hline 
 y & 9 \\
 \hline
z & 2 \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We also suppose that the search engine assigns ad slots using a Gnereralized Second-Price (GSP) auction, and answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	% Question 1
	 \item In this problem, is truthful bidding a Nash equilibrium? To receive full credit, you must either prove that truthful bidding is a Nash equilibrium or show which advertiser(s) could profit by changing their bid away from truthful bidding.

	% Question 2
	\item  Find a Nash equilibrium for this problem (without truthful bidding) in which the total advertiser valuation is maximized (i.e., advertiser x is assigned slot a and advertiser y is assigned slot b). You may use any technique you want to find this Nash equilibrium, but you must convince me that it is an actual Nash equilibrium.
	
	% Question 3
	\item Create a new sponsored search problem with at least 2 slots and at least 3 bidders in which truthful bidding is a Nash equilibrium.
\end{enumerate}
