\begin{enumerate}
	% Question 1
	\item Let every node's population be 1 (i.e., $N_i = 1$  for each i). Let  $\beta = 0.8$ and $\gamma = 0.5$. Let all initial infections be 0 except for node 1; node 1's initial infection should be 0.01 (so  $I_i(0)=0.01$ and $S_i(0)=0.99$ , but all other nodes have $S_i(0)=1$,  $I_i(0) = 0$ and $R_i(0) = 0$). What are the S, I, and R quantities after 1 time step?
\end{enumerate}

% Question 2
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item How many time steps would it take before someone is infected in every node?
\end{enumerate}

% Question 3
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
	\item Suppose that the connection between node 2 and node 1 is removed. If nothing else changes in the network, would this change the spread of the epidemic? Can you predict how many people in node 2 would eventually get sick?
\end{enumerate}

% Question 4
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{3}
	\item Repeat that same thought experiment, but this time let the initial infection start on node 2 (so $I_2(0) = 0.01$ and $S_2(0) = 0.99$, but all other nodes have $S_i(0)=1$, $I_i(0)=0$  and $R_i(0)=0$). Now can you predict how many people in node 2 would eventually get sick?
\end{enumerate}

% Question 5
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	\item Instead, suppose you remove the connection from node 2 to node 1, and replace it with a self-loop on 2 with weight 1. If nothing else changes in the network (and the infection starts at node 1), would this change the spread of the epidemic? Can you predict how many people in node 2 would eventually get sick?
\end{enumerate}
