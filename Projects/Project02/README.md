NOTES:


 Since this program only takes acptrues of the ten segments the segrgation will happen within the first tenth of the iteration and theirfore the schelling segregation working is lost.  However this can be changed by manually change the number of iterations as the keyword arguemnt in the call to the grapgh genoratoer object essentaily changeng the 'GraphGenerator.num_iterations'.
