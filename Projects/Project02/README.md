NOTES:

To install all dependencies a .txt file has been provided with basic packges to be installed via ```pip install```.  To install all dependencies type command ```python -m pip install -r requirments.txt``` from the parent directory where the requirments.txt file is located.  

When running this program ```SchellingSegregation``` Several outputs are produced during execution and several keywords have been added to the mthod to controll verbosity out the program that is logged to a ```.log``` file.  From here we can pvoe the functionality of the program and to help understand how the code is ran.  Below the decleration of classes and methods is the assignments section spli up.  Deliverable one is a simple small test run with verbosity on to display and save information to the user to show how it works.  To other two executables are ran where the sessions of different values is ran for values in a list that are divded up envenly.  The user can set up how many itterations to envenly divide number from 0 to 1.  Sometime the amount of infomation is to much and a lower frequency might be suggested. For each deliverable a while loop was inplemented to hopfully get around the bitmap failure error.  Each run is ititaied by the used input one ot the options.  The used can quit the program by inputting quit which will keep to program from clearing out at the end of each run.  If ran all at once, the graphs, giff, and plots will be deleted (except for desired deliverable plots).  To view the avg. runs for each training session these must be view before executing the next for loop of varying values to test.  The program will prompt the user to enter enter to coniute to execute the code and will delete all the non pertentent graphs and gifs. There is also a function made to be passed a list of breaking points to capture information to increase verbosity.
